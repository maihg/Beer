# beer.Beer
This is my hobby project. I will try to make an amazing application that can
*  Show what kind of beers that has been made
*  Let you add new recipes
*  Register days from start so that it calculates the dates for different tasks for you
*  Let you register notes about the different beers
*  Tell you if the beer is done and ready for bottles

I hope that this will work well. The plan is to use Apache Derby as a local database (no login) and Java Persistance API.
