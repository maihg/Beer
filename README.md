# Beer
This is my hobby project. I will try to make an amazing application that can
*  Show what kind of beers that has been made
*  Let you add new recipes
*  Register days from start so that it calculates the dates for different tasks for you
*  Let you register notes about the different beers
*  Tell you if the beer is done and ready for bottles

I hope that this will work well. The plan is to use Apache Derby as a local database (no login) and Java Persistance API.

A project where I made a small application for keeping track of your home brewings. It is made with a darkmode style - I made it for fun so UD has not been in focus. In the application you can enter different recipes with instructions days and hours after start, the application then calculates the date and time you should do what the instruction says. The application uses Apache Derby (and JPA) and has a resource local database.
